<p class="text-left intro">Neighborhood Walkabouts were created by Ben Goldberg, Jocelyn Glazier, and Steve Goldberg. Ben coded this webpage with design assistance from Jocelyn and Steve.</p>
<p class="question">Q: What are Neighborhood Walkabouts?</p>
<p class="answer">A: A Neighborhood Walkabout is a set of pictures of new and exciting places in your neighborhood that you have to find. Neighborhood Walkabouts are a good way to get outside while having fun. Neighborhood Walkabouts are totally free and the code for this website is open source.</p>
<p class="question">Q: What inspired us to create Neighborhood Walkabouts?</p>
<p class="answer">A: We created Neighborhood Walkabouts to help people find something joyful and fun to do during the 2019/2020 COVID-19 outbreak.</p>
<p class="question">Q: Who should do Neighborhood Walkabouts?</p>
<p class="answer">A: Neighborhood Walkabouts are for everybody (provided you follow social distancing requirements during the outbreak)! If you'd like a short and easy walk, choose a Toddling Walkabout. If you'd like a medium Walkabout, choose a Walking Walkabout. If you're up for a challenge, choose a Journeying Walkabout.</p>
<p class="question">Q: How do I find Walkabouts near me?</p>
<p class="answer">A: Click on the "Map" tab above to view all Neighborhood Walkabouts.</p>
<p class="question">Q: How do I do a Neighborhood Walkabout?</p>
<p class="answer">A: There is a list of photos for every Walkabout and GPS coordinates for where it starts. Go to those coordinates, and follow the trail of photos until you find the last one. Some of the photos require you to go down other streets to find them. No photos are on private property. You might consider biking &#x1F6B4; to get to each point faster (and it's more fun in our opinion).</p>
<p class="question">Q: How do I submit a Neighborhood Walkabout?</p>
<p class="answer">A: Click on the "Create a Walkabout" button above for more details. You'll need images of every point and the GPS coordinates for every point in decimal degrees format. Once you submit your walkabout, we'll let you know when it's added to the map.</p>
<p class="question">Q: What should I know before I submit a Neighborhood Walkabout?</p>
<p class="answer">A: The distance for a Walkabout can be anywhere between 0.25 and 3 miles and should have anywhere between 5 and 12 photos. See <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MBmyFML5XXnMuy9EJaidjrxjN-qMsyl7yve5D2MdJz4/edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">this walkabout</a> for an example.</p>
<p class="question">Q: What do I get when I finish a Neighborhood Walkabout?</p>
<p class="answer">A: Fun and satisfaction that you went outside and exercised and maybe found new places in your neighborhood!</p>
